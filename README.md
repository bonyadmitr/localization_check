# LocalizationCheck

Have you got many languages in your Xcode project? Have you ever pushed version with missing values for some language? If you haven't yet, don't you think you will the other day? ;)

LocalizationCheck helps you make sure all your `localization.strings` are fine.

## What does it do?
* Checks that all keys presented in all localizations
* Checks that no duplicates appeared in localizations
